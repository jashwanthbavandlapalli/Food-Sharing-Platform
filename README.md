# Food-Sharing-Platform
A food-sharing platform connects people to reduce food waste and fight hunger by sharing surplus food. Users can post, browse, and request items via an app or website, with features like geolocation and scheduling. It fosters community, promotes sustainability, and redistributes excess food to those in need, creating a positive social impact.
